# LogBook

30/06/2023  

Start this logbook, as stack of changes in documentation of Jelly.

Changed the input latches to 74HC273, with clear. A pulse in clear line, clar the contents of latch. this could be used for get a zero to start loop counter (CL7) and to force a opcode noop at any moment (CL5). 

Remake of list with signals, controls, address and logic tables. 

Need lines for begin and again flags.

__A problem, too many lines for just two 8-bits eeproms__
